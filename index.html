			  <h3>About Me</h3>
				
				<p>I am a student currently studying part-time at RMIT University via Online Universities Australia. The course I am studying is 'Introduction to Information Technology'. The degree I am working towards is a 'Bachelor of Information Technology'.</p> 
					
				<p>Whilst I am studying part-time I am working full-time as a Site Manager at a large Self Storage Facility. I also own an eCommerce business selling High End Men's Grooming products. I started the business about four years ago and saw solid growth. About 18 months ago I sold 50% of the business. This has allowed me to focus my attention on managing the business while my business partner takes care of running the business (E.g. Packing/Shipping Customer orders).</p>
					
				<p>Lastly, I also own a small website which is a 'Business Directory' for a booming suburb in Sydney. I saw the potential of growth and the need for business's in the community to be able to effectively advertise to the local community. The directory is also closely linked with a Facebook Page and Facebook Community Group.</p>	
				
				<h3>A Little Bit More About Me</h3>
				
				<p>I was born and raised in Sydney Australia by Italian Migrant parents. Although my parents are multilingual, English is unfortunately the only language I am able to speak. My highest level of education to date is a 'Diploma in Business Management' which I completed at Martin College.</p>
				
				<p>Some of my interests include:</p>
				<ul>
				 <li>Gaming - <i>Mainly PC Gaming.</i></li>
				 <li>Fishing - <i>Using Hard Plastics on Sandflats is my fishing of choice, but I take what I can get.</i></li>
				 <li>Playing/Watching all sports - <i>but more specifically MotoGP, Soccer and NRL.</i></li>
				 <li>Motorcycling - <i>I did ride a Honda CBR600 but sold it when I started my eCommerce business, but as with most things, once a bug has bitten it stays for life.</i></li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Interest In IT</h2>
				<p>Being so early in my studies it is hard for me to answer honestly where my interest in IT lies as I am sure that once I am exposed to more principles of IT my interest will skew. At this stage I would say that my interests lie with IoT and Web Development. I am interested in IoT and its potential on a more personal level while my interest in Web Development is more inline with my career aspirations.</p>
				<h3>What drove me to IT?</h3>
				<p>I am the youngest of 3 boys and was very young when a PC was introduced into my household. I remember quite vividly the excitement when we upgraded from an IBM 286 to a 386 and then to the 486. That's not including the fun we had gaming on an Atari 400 and Commodore 64. I still remember inserting the cassette into the Commodore 64 and waiting with fingers crossed for about 30 minutes for the game to load hoping that it will work once loaded. My eldest brother pursued a career in IT and is currently a Software Developer working in the US, so I have been exposed to IT for pretty much my entire life and it still amazes me each day how far we have gone and how far we can go.</p>
				<p>Working in a job but not a career led me to think about what I was doing and what options there are for myself. With little IT experience but a passion for IT led me down the path to studying at RMIT. I was weighing up between doing a Marketing Degree or IT Degree as I thought both would compliment my business. Marketing moreso but with little passion for Marketing I opted to study IT as I have shown an aptitude towards IT and it allows me to pursue a career in a field that I am passionate about. As I have a family, giving up my full-time job to study was simply not an option, so I started researching online degrees. I came across a 'Bachelor of IT' course through RMIT and Online Universities Australia which ticked all the right boxes.</p>
				<h3>Where do I want to go?</h3>
				<p>Upon completing my Bachelor Degree I plan to work in the industry as a Web Developer with aspirations of starting up my own IT company offering a range of IT services but specialising in Web Design and Development. Although I can see the shift in the market with AI and shopping options like placing an order verbally through Google Home or Alexa, I do not believe that this will replace websites and will infact drive many companies to update their websites to suit the needs of AI.</p>

		<h2>Personal Profiles</h2>
		  </div>
		  <div id="myersbriggs">
		  <h3>The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</h3>
		  <img src="Myers-Briggs.png" alt="Personality Type Adventurer" width="800px"/>
		  </div>
		  <div>
		  <h4>What Do These Results Mean to Me</h4>
		  <p>I was very surprised to see how these results mirrored previous interactions I have had in my professional and personal relationships. It opened my eyes to see how some of the life choices I have made where I felt stuck and unhappy were influenced by not being true and authentic to myself. By developing awareness of some of my behavioural traits I can recognise patterns in negative interactions, avoid these from happening and learn from them. Only with awareness am I able to move forward and grow as a person.</p>
		  <p>Furthermore, being an Adventurer Personality Type I need to focus on areas that enable me to utilise my creative properties so that I can reach my full potential rather than feeling stagnant.</p>
		  <h4>How the Results Influence My Behaviour in a Team</h4>
		  <p>Adventurers enjoy connecting with others and are likeable people. They work best in teams where they are among their equals. Although they have good networking and social skills, they need time to retreat so they can recharge their batteries and can continue to have these positive interactions with fellow team members.</p>
		  <p>Adventurers don’t keep score or have a 'tit for tat' mentality. They are tolerant, sometimes too tolerant of other team member's work ethics, which can lead them taking on tasks that belong to their colleagues. This creates a flow on effect where some team members don’t pull their own weight while the Adventurer types take on the extra work for the sake of the harmony of the group. Adventurers welcome feedback from others and value other people’s perspectives but if comments become unconstructive criticisms, things can go south quickly, and conflict can occur.</p>
		  <p>People with the Adventurer Personality Type don’t like to be controlled or micromanaged by others. They thrive when they have clear goals and the freedom and flexibility in completing tasks creatively sometimes even unconventionally. Being a leader of a pack can be tricky for Adventurers as they don’t like being domineering or telling people what to do. However, their excellent people skills make them a likeable leader who often gets their hands dirty with the team rather then instructing from afar.</p>
		  <p>On top of the above, as an Adventurer Personality Type I will also bring a unique view point to the table and a constant drive to improve processes and systems.</p>
		  <h4>What to Take Into Account When Forming a Team</h4>
		  <p>As an Adventurer Personality Type I typically get along with all walks of life, so when forming a team it’s important for me to be clear of what the tasks are of the group. If I am unsure, I need to step out of my comfort zone as the 'nice guy' and be assertive and ask for clarity. This is beneficial for the whole team as I have a tendency to take on more than I am responsible for which can have a negative effect on the cohesiveness of the team as some members can feel undervalued.</p> 
		  <p>I need to also focus on my own transparency within the team so that if someone provides feedback that is unconstructive to situation does not escalate and the team can continue to work harmoniously together.</p>

		  <h3>Learning Styles</h3>
		  <img src="Learning_Styles.png" alt="Learning Styles Pie Chart" width="800px"/>
		  </div>
		  <div>
		  <h4>What Do These Results Mean to Me</h4>
		  <p>When reading the results, at first, I had a 'what the' moment as I didn’t agree.  I always thought I was quick and efficient in completing tasks. Upon reflection of past experiences I realised some tasks I started were left incomplete as I would get excited in the beginning to create something and come up with all these great colourful ideas but then it would be left in the too hard basket. Although some of my other projects had wonderful outcomes it is important to have a balance on what is achievable and in what timeframe.</p>
		  <h4>How the Results Influence My Behaviour in a Team</h4>
		  <p>Pragmatists don’t work in a one size fits all model, rather they like experimenting with new ideas and ways of doing things. They don’t like a lot of fluff and get impatient easily, they prefer getting straight to the point.</p>
		  <p>It is important that I am aware of my learning style and how I can sometimes move too quickly for my fellow team members who may need time to process and reflect on the task at hand. Having patience towards other team members who may be looking at a project at a different angle to what I am looking at it will pay dividends on the balance of the team and the project we are working on.</p>
		  <h4>What to Take Into Account When Forming a Team</h4>
		  <p>When forming a team, I need to be conscious of time restraints that do not always allow me to be experimental or creative. Sometimes things just need to be done. Working in a team some people may need to talk about projects to allow them to process ideas and concepts. Although this may not be ideal for my personality, I need to display patience and be a team player to work cohesively.</p>

		  <h3>Psychometrics Test</h3>
		  <img src="psychometrics test.png" alt="Psychometrics Test" width="800px" />
		  </div>
		  <div>
			 <h4>What Do These Results Mean to Me</h4>
			 <p>The results of this test cemented views I already had of some of the personality traits I possess. It was interesting in seeing how the other tests highlighted my creative side where this test focuses on my thoroughness. Although I think outside of the box I take pride in doing things well and plan ahead to achieve this. </p>
			 <h4>How the Results Influence My Behaviour in a Team</h4>
			 <p>Conscientiousness is the personality trait of being careful and diligent. They don’t just simply want to do a task, they want to do it well. They don’t like being dodgy by cutting corners, rather they take pride in the end product they produce. I have great attention to detail through being thorough and organised, which I apply to the tasks at hand to pick up on possible mistakes before they come to light.</p>
			 <h4>What to Take Into Account When Forming a Team</h4>
			 <p>Having attention to detail and being a perfectionist is a good trait but all in context. Sometimes you need to be flexible to get things done. If every team member was like me and a perfectionist, the end product will never be good enough and as such we would never meet deadlines. A well balanced team with some members having a 'that's good enough' mentality is often needed to meet deadlines.</p>

		<h2>What I am working on now</h2>
		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>The project I am currently working on is a Website which will automate a 'Marketing Calendar' based on input by the end-user. The purpose of the website is to provide a guideline for a new business or startup on effective marketing practices to best advertise their product or sale to their customers. This will allow the business the opportunity to grow without the need to pay for a Marketing Manager or outsourcing their marketing until their business has grown to a point that it is financially viable. The website will have a basic free version while a more powerful 'subscription based' paid version will also be available to customers, making the website itself a potentially profitable startup.</p>
		<h3>Motivation</h3>
		<p>My experience as an Entrepreneur is that I have to wear many hats, even if they do not exactly fit. One of the hats that I have to wear but struggle with is how to best advertise a sale or prepare for upcoming sales in advance. This is a common theme I have come across over the years while having general discussions with other entrepreneurs. I've often thought about employing a 'Marketing Manager' myself but my company is not profitable enough at this stage to make that an option. Currently I am utilising 'Buffer' to schedule my social media posts, but I still have to come up with what and when to post. Then while trying to think of a solution I received an assessment from RMIT where I am able to enter the date my assesment is due into their 'Assignment Planner' and it will sync with my calendar a suggested plan to complete the assessment on time. It was at this point where I thought I could use that for my business but for planning advertisements based off a sale instead of an assignment.</p>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>While Marketing Calendars/Plans Templates are freely available from multiple sources they all lack a feature of my website in one way or another. An example of this is they may have the ability for the user to input a sale and it will suggest a plan but that's it, where my website will also provide the ability to schedule posts straight to connected Social Media accounts and also providing the ability for proofing for more advanced users. Providing a 'one stop shop' for a business to control their marketing, from planning all the way through to posting. The initial version will be quite simple, this is to allow a product to be released to the market quickly while future versions are being worked on. </p>
		 </div>
		<div id="versions">	
			<h3>Projected Timeline</h3>
		  
		<img src="Timeline 2.PNG" alt="Projected Timeline" object-fit="contain"/>
			
		<ul>
			<li><b>Version 1</b> - Initial Website. Provides ability for user to input a sale on a specific date and the website will suggest post dates and types. Information will be able to be exported to calendar.</li>
			<p></p>
			<li><b>Version 2</b> - Social Media Account Linking and Post Scheduler will be introduced. This will now allow the user to use the suggested post dates + types and create the post all in the one website.</li>
			<p></p>
			<li><b>Version 3</b> - Multilevel User Accounts and Proofing will be added. This will appeal to larger corporations such as Marketing Firms as it will allow multiple users on to the one account and have a senior staff member approve posts where necessary.</li>
			<p></p>
			<li><b>Version 4</b> - Mobile App. This will increase the appeal to a broader range of users by giving the ability to post straight off their mobile phones. Social Media Influencers are the expected audience with this update but as more and more offices are becoming virtual the ability to create and/or approve a post from a mobile phone is becoming all the more important.</li>
		</ul>
		 </div>	
		<div>
		<p><b>Version 1: </b>This version is very similar to what is out in the market at the moment but with a key difference. My website will not only suggest when to post but will also actually suggest the type of post needed to engage the consumer. As it is also relatively simple it will be quick to release this version of the website to help generate interest and grow the userbase before the next version update.</p>
		 
		<p><b>Version 2: </b>Version 2 is a necessary update which will be required to compete with similar companies like Hootsuite and Buffer (known Social Media scheduling apps). Where this website seperates itself from companies like Buffer and Hootsuite is the ability to not only allow scheduling of posts but to suggest to the user the type of post required. Through Analytics the suggestions will also improve as the algorithm will learn when a particular companies consumer base is most responsive to advertising.</p>
		  
		<p><b>Version 3: </b>An update which is expected to be popular with the current userbase at the time, this will allow multiple users on the one account with the ability to give specific access levels. This would also expand the appeal of the website to larger marketing firms which will for example, allow an intern to schedule a post and a senior staff member the ability to approve the post before going live.</p>
			
		<p><b>Version 4: </b>As mentioned above, this will broaden the appeal to not only businesses or startups but also to Social Media Influencers.</p>	
		 </div>
		 <div>
			 <h3>How Will It Be Used</h3>
		<p>The date is 01 May 2020, I have just entered in a sale event on 01 June 2020 for 40% off. The website will now use current Best Marketing Practices to suggest when to post and what to post. An example of what will be provided to the user is seen below.</p> 
		 </div>	
		
		<div id="Calendar">
			<img src="Calendar.PNG" alt="Website Example" width="800px" />
		 </div>
		
		<div>
		<p>The suggestions will be developed under the advice of an experienced marketing manager or team who will stay in employ to monitor the suggestions for accuracy and to also recommend the necessary changes required to the algorithm to keep up with ever changing marketing trends. An alternative to employing a marketing manager or team is to hire the services of a marketing firm to consult on the best practices. Both options have their own merits, which will have to be evaluated further down the track.</p>
		
		<h3>How Will it Make a Profit</h3>


		<p>The website will offer a Free and Paid Subscription version. Initially the free version will be limited to only one sale event at a time where a paid version will allow multiple sale events for several months in advance, allowing a more useful marketing plan. As the website progresses through to the more advanced versions the majority of features will be available to paid versions only. Social Media Account linking and post scheduling would be available in the free version to match current market leaders.</p>
		
		<h3>Tools and Technologies Required</h3>
		<p>A Server will be required to host the website. This can either be purchased and maintained onsite or sourced through a third party company like Digital Pacific. Google Tag Manager and Adwords will be needed to promote the website to the public to drive usage of the website. Mailchimp can also be utilised for EOM Marketing. Social Media will also be used to advertise the company while also providing updates to current customers. GitHub can be used inhouse for version control and a PC with a program to write the necessary code, for example Notepad++ or Adobe Dreamweaver is also required.</p>
		<h3>Skills Required</h3>
		<p>The initial skills required to build the website would be HTML, CSS and Javascript. A Front end Developer and a Back end Developer would be required to write and maintain the initial code of the website as well as progress the website to future versions. A Marketing Expert will either need to be employed or a third party company consulted to advise on current marketing practices. As the website progresses through to more advanced versions more advanced coding languages like C#, C++ and Swift will be required for the more advanced features of the website and App development. All of which will be easy to source as they are not rare commodities.</p>
		<h3>Outcome</h3>
		<p>Once the project is completed the outcome will be a website which is marketable to small business's and startup's. Not only will it be a marketable product but it is one which has growth potential with the current projection of feature updates. The potential to develop the website and app to appeal to larger corporations and marketing firms means that the customer base will broaden exponentially, thus creating a larger earnings potential. The website will eventually provide a 'one stop shop' for  small businesses and startups all the way to  large Marketing Firms to plan, create and control their marketing. Whilst solving a companies marketing planning needs is the purpose of the website, it will also provide an income to several employess who will be tasked with updating and maintaining the website/app. That is also not counting the additional Admin staff which may be required once the company grows.</p>
